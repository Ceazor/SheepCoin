# SheepCoin

This is a novel MemeCoin project

Its basic premise is that the transfer function is restricted by the token holder count.
🐑 = 1 token can transfer
🐑🐑 = 2 tokens can transfer

This will stop early buyers from buying up huge allocations. and also help to restrict wallets from emptying out all their tokens. 

🔥🛖
The BurnDownTheCabin is for burning the LP tokens if the deployer has be donated some amount. Ideally, the amount of tokens should
equal the amount of right side token that was put in the LP for init liquidity.

This token is not likely to make anyone any money. This is not an investment. This is a game. If you are afraid of loosing, consider just counting the sheep.
